# Google sign in warnings

This is a repo for reproducing weird Xcode warnings after including `GoogleSignIn` as a dependency
in an iOS project

### Setup

Ensure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed on your machine as a global dependency and:

```
pod install
```

After successfully installed the dependency, build and run the project to see the warnings that will appear
in your Xcode's console
